This repository contains a full PEFT pipeline with model quantization and LoRA adapters. The model is hosted in Hugging Face, downloaded with a quantized version and LoRA adapters are added in order to train the model. The trained model/adapters are pushed back to a personal repo in [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/bmartinc80/gemma-ft)
